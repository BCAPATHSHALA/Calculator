# Calculator

The Calculator JavaScript project is a web-based application designed to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application provides users with a user-friendly interface that allows them to enter numbers and perform calculations with ease.

The calculator consists of a display panel that shows the input and output of the calculations. The user can enter numbers either by clicking on the buttons or by typing them using the keyboard. The application provides a clear button that allows the user to clear the input and start a new calculation.

The Calculator JavaScript project is a great way for users to practice their math skills and perform quick calculations without the need for a physical calculator. It is also a great way for beginner programmers to practice their JavaScript skills and learn how to create interactive web applications.
